                        <p className='mx-10 mt-7 mb-5'>KRR is a research group based in Computer Science at the University of Cape Town. The group works on various aspects of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning. At present our focus is on belief change, defeasible reasoning, and other forms of non-monotonic and non-classical reasoning.</p>
                        <p className='mx-10 mb-10'>We are always looking for good postgraduate students to join the group. If you have an interest in logic-based Artificial Intelligence, please contact Prof Tommie Meyer at tmeyer@cair.org.za. Details about postgraduate admission in Computer Science at UCT can be found here: </p>
